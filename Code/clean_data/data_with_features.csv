So just how challenging is the Common Core exam?  In the third installment in his series Crisis In The Classroom, James Ford takes the 8th grade Common Core English Language Arts exam.  

How well would you do on the exam intended for early teens?  James shows why, even while armed with not one but two Ivy League degrees, aspects of the test can be a challenge.  He also interviews a psychologist on the effects of taking the exam, as well as the effect of choosing to opt out.
